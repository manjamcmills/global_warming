# Global Climate change & its effects
‚Ä¢	  Our team is passionate about science üë©‚Äçüî¨
We want to understand if global temperatures have changed within the last 20 years, and what temperatures would look like in the future 20 years from today. Our team is measuring historical global climate change using the 4 variables listed below:
1.	Sea levels
2.	Carbon emissions
3.	Polar ice caps
4.	Surface temperatures
Questions of curiosity include: Are temperatures rising? Are they cooling? Does climate change exist?
We will be forecasting future carbon emissions using historical carbon emission data.

The team wanted to upload date to a database in PGAdmin. I loaded 3 of the files into PGadmin at which point we decided to pivot and analyze our data in Python as that made better sense with us in the direction we wanted to take with out project. 

Reshpal- This week gathered data on sealevels (2 csv files) and added them to python to start data cleaning and analysis. The sealevels data is to explore rising sea levels across the world which could cause catastrophic events (such as one day the bay area being underwater! Time to get a boat!
