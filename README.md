# sea_ice
* all data is from https://nsidc.org/data/g02135/versions/3
* The original file had 4 sheets, I split into 4 separate csv files 
  1. sea_ice_NH_extent.csv
  2. sea_ice_NH_area.csv
  3. sea_ice_SH_extent.csv
  4. sea_ice_SH_area.csv
* In the file sea_ice.ipynb, I uploaded all 4 csv files
* For each csv, I cleaned the data so that the year (1978-2022) was the index and the individual months plus the annual average was the column headers
*
