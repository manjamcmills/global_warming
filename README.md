> Global Climate change & its effects

- [ ] Our team is passionate about science 👩‍🔬

We want to understand if global temperatures have changed within the last 20 years, and what temperatures would look like in the future 20 years from today.
Our team is measuring historical global climate change using the 4 variables listed below:
1. Sea levels
2. Carbon emissions
3. Polar ice caps
4. Surface temperatures

Questions of curiosity include: *Are temperatures rising? Are they cooling? Does climate change exist?*


We will be forecasting future carbon emissions using historical carbon emission data.
