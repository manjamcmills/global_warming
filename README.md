> Global Climate change & its effects
- [ ] Our team is passionate about science 👩‍🔬

We want to understand if global temperatures have changed within the last 20 years, and what temperatures would look like in the future 20 years from today.
Our team is measuring historical global climate change using the 4 variables listed below:
1. Sea levels
2. Carbon emissions
3. Polar ice caps
4. Surface temperatures

Questions of curiosity include: *Are temperatures rising? Are they cooling? Does climate change exist?*


We will be forecasting future carbon emissions using historical carbon emission data.

1. Went and found more info from these data sources below: 
CO2 Atmospheric data source citation

Methodology:

The details of measurement of CO₂ concentrations at the Mauna Loa Observatory are available at the following link: https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/about/co2_measurements.html

The year-on-year changes in the CO₂ concentrations are calculated by the IMF.


--- Main measurement in my data source included measuring the % of Monthly Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide Concentration (CO2 saturation in Earth's atmosphere (the air that we breathe)) from 1960-2021 as well as measuring the Parts Per Million (Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide Concentrations in PPM) in the same timeframe. 

In the screenshots from Matplotlib, you’ll find a positive trend line. We plan to investigate what that means with CO2 and how that contributes to rising temperatures.
