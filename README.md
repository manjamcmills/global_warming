# Global Climate change & its effects
‚Ä¢	  Our team is passionate about science üë©‚Äçüî¨
We want to understand if global temperatures have changed within the last 20 years, and what temperatures would look like in the future 20 years from today. Our team is measuring historical global climate change using the 4 variables listed below:
1.	Sea levels
2.	Carbon emissions
3.	Polar ice caps
4.	Surface temperatures
Questions of curiosity include: Are temperatures rising? Are they cooling? Does climate change exist?
We will be forecasting future carbon emissions using historical carbon emission data.

The team wanted to upload date to a database in PGAdmin. I loaded 3 of the files into PGadmin at which point we decided to pivot and analyze our data in Python as that made better sense with us in the direction we wanted to take with out project. 

Reshpal- This week gathered data on sealevels (2 csv files) and added them to python to start data cleaning and analysis. The sealevels data is to explore rising sea levels across the world which could cause catastrophic events (such as one day the bay area being underwater! Time to get a boat!

Global warming Week 2 (11/7-11/13): 
Now that we have the data files pulled, we start to clean them. The first data set I began to review was from Kaggle on sea levels rising. As I began to dig into the data to clean it, many issues were discovered. The first was trying to understand the data. The column headers were not clear what the data represented. Reading through the site and the references we could not find an exact determination on what the column headers referenced and if this data was meaningful for our project. We decided to put this data set aside and work with a better data set we found from climatedata.imf.org that shows change in mean sea levels across the world.  The data was imported to Python. The file was cleaned and the data will be displayed on the website.
