> Global Climate change & its effects
- [ ] Our team is passionate about science 👩‍🔬

We want to understand if global temperatures have changed within the last 20 years, and what temperatures would look like in the future 20 years from today.
Our team is measuring historical global climate change using the 4 variables listed below:
1. Sea levels
2. Carbon emissions
3. Polar ice caps
4. Surface temperatures

Questions of curiosity include: *Are temperatures rising? Are they cooling? Does climate change exist?*


We will be forecasting future carbon emissions using historical carbon emission data.

Krista portion 11/13: 

1. Went and found more info from these data sources below: 
CO2 Atmospheric data source citation

Source: Dr. Pieter Tans, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
Global Monitoring Laboratory, Trends in Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide Data (https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/trends/) 
and Dr. Ralph Keeling, Scripps Institution of Oceanography, Carbon Dioxide Measurements (https://scrippsco2.ucsd.edu/).
Accessed on 2022-09-30.


Methodology:

The details of measurement of CO₂ concentrations at the Mauna Loa Observatory are available at the following link: https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/about/co2_measurements.html

The year-on-year changes in the CO₂ concentrations are calculated by the IMF.


--- Main measurement in my data source included measuring the % of Monthly Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide Concentration (CO2 saturation in Earth's atmosphere (the air that we breathe)) from 1960-2021 as well as measuring the Parts Per Million (Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide Concentrations in PPM) in the same timeframe. 

In the screenshots from Matplotlib, you’ll find a positive trend line. We plan to investigate what that means with CO2 and how that contributes to rising temperatures. 

Update 11/20: 

I created 3 separate supprting documents for the whole team to work on that will guide the main project to completion. 
1st doc = final project google slides
2nd doc = data gathering google sheets 
3rd doc = final read.me collab. 

- wrote the script + collaborated with everyone on the group project every single day this week for 2-3 hours each day
- gathered all data references and will prepare final collaboration soon

We added in a specific theme to our final presentation (took feedback from first run through) and now we're ready to go.
